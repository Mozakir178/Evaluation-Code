

Q1) 

a) Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? And Write
some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.

ans)

The String object are stored in String constant pool area. and it makes the String immutable.
The String is immutable in Java Because of the security reason. 
String is immurable because of security, synchronization and class loading.
The resaon of making string final is to destroy the immutability and not allow others to extend it. 

difference between String and StringBuilder.

String:  -
String is immutable.
String is stored in SCP area.
even after setting its value to null String is not eligible for garbage collector.
String is Special Class.

StringBuilder :-
String builder is mutable.
StringBuilder is stored in heap area.
after setting its value to null StringBuilder object is eligible for garbage collector.
String Builder is Class.
	
	Methods on String:-
	equals() Method.
	String s1 = "MASAI SCHOOL" ;
	String s2 = "MASAI SCHOOL" ;
	
	if(s1.equals(s2)){
	System.out.println("Both string are same") // Both String are same
	}
	
	toUpperCase() method :- 
	String s1 = "India" ;
	String s2 = s1.toUpperCase() ;
	System.out.println(s2) ; // "INDIA" 
	
	
	toLowerCase() method :- 
	String s1 = "INDIA" ;
	String s2 = s1.toLowerCase() ;
	System.out.println(s2)  ; //  "india"
	
	charAt() method :-
	String s1 = "String 1"
	char character = s1.charAt(3) ;
	System.out.println(character) ;// i
	
	length() method :-
	String s1 = "Normal String" ;
	int len = s1.length() ;
	System.out.println(len) ; // 13 


b) What is the difference between equals method and == operator in java? And what will be the output of the
following code snippets and giving proper explanation.

	ans) 
		 equals method compare the content of an object to another object while == operator compare the ref add of the object.
		 
		 
		 Code snippet 1 :
		 	true ;
		 	
		 Code snippet 2 :
		 	true ;
		 	
		 Code snippet3 :
		 	true ;
