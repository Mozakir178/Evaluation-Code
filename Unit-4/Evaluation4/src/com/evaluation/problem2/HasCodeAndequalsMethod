		HashCode can be define as it is an integer value associated with every object in Java.
		Each object will have different HashCode if contain is different.
		It is use for hashing in hash table.
		To get this hashcode value for an object we can use inbuild method.
		We can also Override this HashCode Method in child class.
		HashCode is define in Object class.
		So we can call this HashCode method a predefine method also.
		HashCode will give similar hashcode for two object if equals method give true.
		
			Example.
				Object.hashCode(bookName) ;
					It will give an integer number.
			
	Equals Method:
		The equals() is also a method available in the Object class.
		It is use to compare two object are equals or not.
		As it is declare in the Object class it is also a predefine method.
		But we can Override this method in the child class.
		If all the contains of two object is simiallar we can make thos two object logically equal.
		By default two object will be same only if they are store in same memory.
		
			Example.
				object1.equlas(object2) ; 
					 It will give true or false according to situation.
