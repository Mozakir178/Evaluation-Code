	Early Binding : 
		The binding which can be resolved at compiler time by the compiler is known as the Early binding.
		Binding of all the static private is done at comile time.
		Also all final and method are also bind at compile time.
		
			Ex.
				public class EarlyBinding{
				 	static final int num = 50 ;
				static void fun1(){
				System.out.println("Binding of this method will be done at compile time") ;
				}
				}
				
	
	Late Binding : 
		The late binding is also called as dynamic binding.
		In late or dynamic binding, the compiler does not decide the method to be called. 
		It is decide by jvm which method should be bind.
		The Overriding is the perfect exemple of late Binding.
		There both child and super class have same method but it is decided at JVM.
		
			Ex.
				
				public abstract class LateBinding{
				
					public abstract void print() ;
					} 
					
				
				
				public class A extends LateBinding{
				
					@Override
					public void print(){
						System.out.println("This is the example of late binding") ;
					}
					}
