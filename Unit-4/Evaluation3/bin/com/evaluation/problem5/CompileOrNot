	a) Does the below code compile successfully? If not, why?
		interface A{
				int i = 111;
			}
			
		class B implements A{
				void methodB(){
					i = 222;
			}
		}
	
	
	Ans ) 
		
		The answer of the above code is No.
		The above code will not compile successfully.
		
		Reason : 
			The reason because of which above code will cot compile successfully is class B is Implementing A.
			And we know that in abstract every variable is consider as final.
			So we can not change the value of the variable i.
			That is why this program will give compile time error.
